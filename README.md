TuneTempoTape Application for Android

-Tune: Play sine tones in all notes and three different octaves (Hz given as well)

-Tempo: Metronome 

-Tape: Record uncompressed audio along and use metronome to play along. (I'd recommend using headphones when recording otherwise the metronome will bleed into recording)
